    "- Write a pipeline that takes in cell detections and links them across time to obtain lineage trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods/Tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`networkx`**: To represent the tracking inputs and outputs as graphs. Tracking is often framed\n",
    "    as a graph optimization problem. Nodes in the graph represent detections, and edges represent links\n",
    "    across time. The \"tracking\" task is then framed as selecting the correct edges to link your detections.\n",
    "- **`motile`**: To set up and solve an Integer Linear Program (ILP) for tracking.\n",
    "    ILP-based methods frame tracking as a constrained optimization problem. The task is to select a subset of nodes/edges from a \"candidate graph\" of all possible nodes/edges. The subset must minimize user-defined costs (e.g. edge distance), while also satisfying a set of tracking constraints (e.g. each cell is linked to at most one cell in the previous frame). Note: this tracking approach is not inherently using\n",
    "    \"deep learning\" - the costs and constraints are usually hand-crafted to encode biological and data-based priors, although cost features can also be learned from data.\n",
    "- **`napari`**: To visualize tracking inputs and outputs. Qualitative analysis is crucial for tuning the\n",
    "    weights of the objective function and identifying data-specific costs and constraints.\n",
    "- **`trackastra`**: To predict linking scores for cells in adjacent time points. `trackastra` is a transformer-based deep learning model, \n",
    "    with published pre-trained models that work on many types of input.\n",
    "- **`traccuracy`**: To evaluate tracking results. Metrics such as accuracy can be misleading for tracking,\n",
    "    because rare events such as divisions are much harder than the common linking tasks, and might\n",
    "    be more biologically relevant for downstream analysis. Therefore, it is important to evaluate on\n",
    "    a wide range of error metrics and determine which are most important for your use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "After running through the full tracking pipeline, from loading to evaluation, we will learn how to **incorporate custom costs** based on dataset-specific prior information and deep learning models.\n",

You will want a positive weight, since higher distances should be more costly, unlike in the example when higher scores were good and so we inverted them with a negative weight.</li>\n",
    "    <li>Because distance is always positive, and you want a positive weight, you will want to include a negative constant on the <code>EdgeDistance</code> cost. If there are no negative selection costs, the ILP will always select nothing, because the cost of selecting nothing is zero.</li>\n",

    "[Trackastra](https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2024/papers_ECCV/papers/09819.pdf) is a transformer-based method for cell tracking. The method trains a transformer to predict an association score for each possible edge in the candidate graph, and then uses that score combined with distance to perform linking. The [trackastra package](https://github.com/weigertlab/trackastra) has published a general 2D model trained on a variety of datasets, which we will use to predict edge scores for our candidate graph. We will then incorporate the scores into our ILP in a similar fashion to our hand-crafted drift distance."
