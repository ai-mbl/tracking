# # Exercise 9: Tracking-by-detection with an integer linear program (ILP)
#
# Objective:
# - Write a pipeline that takes in cell detections and links them across time to obtain lineage trees
#
# Methods/Tools:
#
# - **`networkx`**: To represent the tracking inputs and outputs as graphs. Tracking is often framed
#     as a graph optimization problem. Nodes in the graph represent detections, and edges represent links
#     across time. The "tracking" task is then framed as selecting the correct edges to link your detections.
# - **`motile`**: To set up and solve an Integer Linear Program (ILP) for tracking.
#     ILP-based methods frame tracking as a constrained optimization problem. The task is to select a subset of nodes/edges from a "candidate graph" of all possible nodes/edges. The subset must minimize user-defined costs (e.g. edge distance), while also satisfying a set of tracking constraints (e.g. each cell is linked to at most one cell in the previous frame). Note: this tracking approach is not inherently using
#     "deep learning" - the costs and constraints are usually hand-crafted to encode biological and data-based priors, although cost features can also be learned from data.
# - **`napari`**: To visualize tracking inputs and outputs. Qualitative analysis is crucial for tuning the
#     weights of the objective function and identifying data-specific costs and constraints.
# - **`traccuracy`**: To evaluate tracking results. Metrics such as accuracy can be misleading for tracking,
#     because rare events such as divisions are much harder than the common linking tasks, and might
#     be more biologically relevant for downstream analysis. Therefore, it is important to evaluate on
#     a wide range of error metrics and determine which are most important for your use case.
#
# After running through the full tracking pipeline, from loading to evaluation, we will learn how to **incorporate custom costs** based on dataset-specific prior information. As a bonus exercise,
# you can learn how to **learn the best cost weights** for a task from
# from a small amount of ground truth tracking information.
#
# You can run this notebook on your laptop, a GPU is not needed.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Section 0: Setup
# The setup.sh script already installed dependencies and downloaded the dataset we will be using. However, since we will be using `napari` to interactively visualize our tracking results, if you are running this nodebook on a remove machine, we need to set up a few things.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Set up NoMachine with port forwarding
# 1. From VSCode connected to your remote machine, forward a port (e.g. `4000`) to your local machine.
#     - Open you command palette in VSCode (usually CMD-Shift-P) and type "forward a port"
#     - Then type in the desired port number `4000` and hit enter
#     - From the "PORTS" tab, you should see port 4000 listed as a forwarded port
# 2. Download and install [NoMachine](https://www.nomachine.com/download) on your local machine if it is not already installed.
# 3. Enter the server address in host, set the port to match the port you forwarded in step 1 and protocol as NX. Feel free to enter any name you would like.
# 4. Click on the configuration tab on the left.
# 5. Choose "Use key-based authentication with a key you provide" and hit the "Modify" button.
# 6. Provide the path to your ssh key .pem file.
# 7. Finally hit connect (or Add).
# 8. If you are asked to create a desktop, click yes.
# 9. You should then see a time and date, hitting enter should let you enter your username and access the desktop. The first login may be slow.
# 10. Still in NoMachine, open a shell window. Hit the application button in the bottom left corner and launch "Konsole"
# 11. From the shell, run `echo $DISPLAY`. Copy the output. It should be something like `:1005`
# 12. Return to your notebook in VSCode, and proceed with the exercise.
# 13. Modify the cell below to input the DISPLAY port you retrieved in step 11

# ## Section 1: Visualize the data

# %% [markdown]
# ### Load the dataset and inspect it in napari

# %% [markdown]
# For this exercise we will be working with a fluorescence microscopy time-lapse of breast cancer cells with stained nuclei (SiR-DNA). It is similar to the dataset at https://zenodo.org/record/4034976#.YwZRCJPP1qt. The raw data, pre-computed segmentations, detection probabilities, and ground truth tracks are saved in a zarr. The segmentation was generated with a pre-trained StartDist model, so there may be some segmentation errors which can affect the tracking process. The detection probabilities also come from StarDist, and are downsampled in x and y by 2 compared to the detections and raw data.

# %% [markdown]
# Here we load the raw image data, segmentation, and probabilities from the zarr, and view them in napari.

# %%
data_path = "./data/breast_cancer_fluo.zarr"
data_root = zarr.open(data_path, 'r')
image_data = data_root["raw"][:]
segmentation = data_root["seg"][:]
probabilities = data_root["probs"][:]

# %%
viewer = napari.Viewer()

# %% [markdown]
# Let's use [napari](https://napari.org/tutorials/fundamentals/getting_started.html) to visualize the data. Napari is a wonderful viewer for imaging data that you can interact with in python, even directly out of jupyter notebooks. If you've never used napari, you might want to take a few minutes to go through [this tutorial](https://napari.org/stable/tutorials/fundamentals/viewer.html). Here we visualize the raw data, the predicted segmentations, and the predicted probabilities as separate layers. You can toggle each layer on and off in the layers list on the left.

# %%

viewer.add_image(probabilities, name="probs", scale=(1, 2, 2))
viewer.add_image(image_data, name="raw")
viewer.add_labels(segmentation, name="seg")

# %% [markdown]
# After running the previous cell, open NoMachine and check for an open napari window.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Read in the ground truth graph and inspect it in napari
# In addition to the image data and segmentations, we also have a ground truth tracking solution.
# The ground truth tracks are stored in a [`geff`](http://liveimagetrackingtools.org/geff/latest/) (Graph Exchange File Format) group in the zarr.
# This is a new format that is in the process of being adopted by the tracking community, with support for import/export from a variety of
# common tools, such as TrackMate, `trackastra`, `napari`, and `traccuracy`.
#
# Each node in the graph represents a detection, and has properties `t`, `y`, and `x` holding the location of that detection.
# Edges in the graph link detected cells between time frames: edges go from a detection in time `t` to the same cell (or its daughter) detected in time `t + 1`.
# Note that there are no ground truth segmentations - each detection is just a point representing the center of a cell.
#
# Here we load the graph using the `geff` API into a `networkx` graph, a common library for working with graphs in Python. Specifically, we load it into a [`nx.DiGraph`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/classes/digraph.html), since our edges are directed.
#

# %%
gt_tracks, metadata = geff.read_nx("data/breast_cancer_fluo.zarr/gt_tracks.geff")
print(f"The ground truth tracks have {gt_tracks.number_of_nodes()} nodes and {gt_tracks.number_of_edges()} edges")

# %% [markdown]
# Here we set up a napari widget for visualizing the tracking results. This is part of the motile napari plugin, not part of core napari.
# If you get a napari error that the viewer window is closed, please re-run the previous visualization cell to re-open the viewer window.

# %%
widget = plugin_widgets.TreeWidget(viewer)
viewer.window.add_dock_widget(widget, name="Lineage View", area="right")

# %% [markdown]
# Here we add a "MotileRun" to the napari tracking visualization widget (the "view_controller"). A MotileRun includes a name, a set of tracks, and a segmentation. The tracking visualization widget will add:
# - a Points layer with the points in the tracks
# - a Tracks layer to display the track history as a "tail" behind the point in the current time frame
# - a Labels layer, if a segmentation was provided
# - a Lineage View widget, which displays an abstract graph representation of all the solution tracks
#
# These views are synchronized such that every element is colored by the track ID of the element. Clicking on a node in the Lineage View will navigate to that cell in the data, and vice versa.
#
# Hint - if your screen is too small, you can "pop out" the lineage tree view into a separate window using the icon that looks like two boxes in the top left of the lineage tree view. You can also close the tree view with the x just above it, and open it again from the menu bar: Plugins -> Motile -> Lineage View (then re-run the below cell to add the data to the lineage view).

# %%
assign_tracklet_ids(gt_tracks)
ground_truth_run = MotileRun(
    run_name="ground_truth",
    tracks=gt_tracks,

widget.view_controller.update_napari_layers(ground_truth_run, time_attr="t", pos_attr=("x", "y"))

# %% [markdown]
# ## Section 2 (Task 1) Build a candidate graph
#
# To set up our tracking problem, we will create a "candidate graph" - a DiGraph that contains all possible detections (graph nodes) and links (graph edges) between them.
#
# Then we use an optimization method called an integer linear program (ILP) to select the best nodes and edges from the candidate graph to generate our final tracks.
#
# To create our candidate graph, we will use the provided StarDist segmentations.
# Each node in the candidate graph represents one segmentation, and each edge represents a potential link between segmentations. This candidate graph will also contain features that will be used in the optimization task, such as position on nodes and, later, customized scores on edges.


# %% [markdown]
# <div class="alert alert-block alert-info"><h3>Task 1: Extract candidate nodes from the predicted segmentations</h3>
# First we need to turn each segmentation into a node in a `networkx.DiGraph`.
# Use <a href=https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.measure.html#skimage.measure.regionprops>skimage.measure.regionprops</a> to extract properties from each segmentation, and create a candidate graph with nodes only.
#
#
# Here are the requirements for the output graph:
# <ol>
#     <li>Each detection (unique label id) in the segmentation becomes a node in the graph</li>
#     <li>The node id is the label of the detection</li>

# ## Section 3 (Task 2): Set up the tracking optimization problem

# %% [markdown]
# As hinted earlier, our goal is to prune the candidate graph. More formally we want to find a graph $\tilde{G}=(\tilde{V}, \tilde{E})$ whose vertices $\tilde{V}$ are a subset of the candidate graph vertices $V$ and whose edges $\tilde{E}$ are a subset of the candidate graph edges $E$.
#
#
# Finding a good subgraph $\tilde{G}=(\tilde{V}, \tilde{E})$ can be formulated as an [integer linear program (ILP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming) (also, refer to the tracking lecture slides), where we assign a binary variable $x$ and a cost $c$ to each vertex and edge in $G$, and then computing $min_x c^Tx$.
#
# A set of linear constraints ensures that the solution will be a feasible cell tracking graph. For example, if an edge is part of $\tilde{G}$, both its incident nodes have to be part of $\tilde{G}$ as well.
#
# `motile` ([docs here](https://funkelab.github.io/motile/)), makes it easy to link with an ILP in python by implementing common linking constraints and costs.

# <div class="alert alert-block alert-info"><h3>Task 2: Set up a basic motile tracking pipeline</h3>
# <p>Use the motile <a href=https://funkelab.github.io/motile/quickstart.html#sec-quickstart>quickstart</a> example to set up a basic motile pipeline for our task.
#
# Here are some key similarities and differences between the quickstart and our task:
# <ul>
#     <li>We do not have scores on our edges. However, we can use the edge distance as a cost, so that longer edges are more costly than shorter edges. Instead of using the <code>EdgeSelection</code> cost, we can use the <a href=https://funkelab.github.io/motile/api.html#edgedistance><code>EdgeDistance</code></a> cost with <code>position_attribute="pos"</code>. You will want a positive weight, since higher distances should be more costly, unlike in the example when higher scores were good and so we inverted them with a negative weight.</li>
#     <li>Because distance is always positive, and you want a positive weight, you will want to include a negative constant on the <code>EdgeDistance</code> cost. If there are no negative selection costs, the ILP will always select nothing, because the cost of selecting nothing is zero.</li>
#     <li>We want to allow divisions. So, we should pass in 2 to our <code>MaxChildren</code> constraint. The <code>MaxParents</code> constraint should have 1, the same as the quickstart, because neither task allows merging.</li>
#     <li>You should include an <code>Appear</code> cost and a <code>NodeSelection</code> cost similar to the one in the quickstart.</li>
# </ul>
#
# Once you have set up the basic motile optimization task in the function below, you will probably need to adjust the weight and constant values on your costs until you get a solution that looks reasonable.

# ## Section 4: Visualize the Result
# Rather than just looking at printed statistics about our solution, let's visualize it in `napari`.
#
# Before we can create our MotileRun, we need to create an output segmentation from our solution. Our output segmentation differs from our input segmentation in two main ways:
# 1. Not all candidate nodes will be selected in our solution graph. We need to filter the masks corresponding to the un-selected candidate detections out of the output segmentation.
# 2. Segmentations will be relabeled so that the same cell will be the same label (and thus color) over time. Cells will still change label/color at division.
#
# Note that bad tracking results at this point does not mean that you implemented anything wrong! We still need to customize our costs and constraints to the task before we can get good results. As long as your pipeline selects something, and you can kind of interepret why it is going wrong, that is all that is needed at this point.

# ## Section 5: Evaluation Metrics
#
# We were able to understand via visualizing the predicted tracks on the images that the basic solution is far from perfect for this problem.
#
# Additionally, we would also like to quantify this. We will use the package [`traccuracy`](https://traccuracy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to calculate some [standard metrics for cell tracking](http://celltrackingchallenge.net/evaluation-methodology/). For this exercise, we'll take a look at the following metrics:
#
# - **TRA**: TRA is a metric established by the [Cell Tracking Challenge](http://celltrackingchallenge.net). It compares your solution graph to the ground truth graph and measures how many changes to edges and nodes would need to be made in order to make the graphs identical. TRA ranges between 0 and 1 with 1 indicating a perfect match between the solution and the ground truth. While TRAf is convenient to use in that it gives us a single number, it doesn't tell us what type of mistakes are being made in our solution.
# - **Node Errors**: We can look at the number of false positive and false negative nodes in our solution which tells us how how many cells are being incorrectly included or excluded from the solution.
# - **Edge Errors**: Similarly, the number of false positive and false negative edges in our graph helps us assess what types of mistakes our solution is making when linking cells between frames.
# - **Division Errors**: Finally, as biologists we are often very interested in the division events that occur and want to ensure that they are being accurately identified. We can look at the number of true positive, false positive and false negative divisions to assess how our solution is capturing these important events.


# %% [markdown]
# The metrics we want to compute require a ground truth segmentation. Since we do not have a ground truth segmentation, we can make one by drawing a circle around each ground truth detection. While not perfect, it will be good enough to match ground truth to predicted detections in order to compute metrics.

# ## Section 6 (Task 3): Incorporating prior knowledge
#
# There 3 main ways to encode prior knowledge about your task into the motile tracking pipeline.
# 1. Add an attribute to the candidate graph and incorporate it with an existing cost
# 2. Change the structure of the candidate graph
# 3. Add a new type of cost or constraint
#
# The first way is the most common, and is quite flexible, so we will focus on an example of this type of customization.

# ### Incorporating Known Direction of Motion
#
# So far, we have been using motile's EdgeDistance as an edge selection cost, which penalizes longer edges by computing the Euclidean distance between the endpoints. However, in our dataset we see a trend of upward motion in the cells, and the false detections at the top are not moving. If we penalize movement based on what we expect, rather than Euclidean distance, we can select more correct cells and penalize the non-moving artefacts at the same time.
#

# %% [markdown]
# <div class="alert alert-block alert-info"><h3>Task 3a: Add a drift distance attribute</h3>
# <p> For this task, we need to determine the "expected" amount of motion, then add an attribute to our candidate edges that represents distance from the expected motion direction. Look at the dataset in `napari` and see how much the cells move on average, and in which direction, to get the expected "drift" quantity. A more principled way could also be to compute the average edge direction in the ground truth annotations, but since we are evaluating on this dataset as well, that could be considered "cheating."</p>

# ## Section 7 (Task 4) - Incorporating Trackastra Scores
#
# [Trackastra](https://www.ecva.net/papers/eccv_2024/papers_ECCV/papers/09819.pdf) is a transformer-based method for cell tracking. The method trains a transformer to predict an association score for each possible edge in the candidate graph, and then uses that score combined with distance to perform linking. The [trackastra package](https://github.com/weigertlab/trackastra) has published a general 2D model trained on a variety of datasets, which we will use to predict edge scores for our candidate graph. We will then incorporate the scores into our ILP in a similar fashion to our hand-crafted drift distance.

# %%
# download the pretrained model
model = trackastra.model.Trackastra.from_pretrained("general_2d", device="automatic")
# predict
predictions = model._predict(image_data, segmentation)
trackastra_nodes = predictions["nodes"]
trackastra_scores = predictions["weights"]
# show representative outputs
print("Example node output:", trackastra_nodes[0])
print("Example score output", trackastra_scores[0])


# %% [markdown]
# You can see that the trackastra model prediction outputs a set of nodes. Each node has:
# - `id`, the trackastra defined identifier for the node
# - `coords`, the location of the node in space
# - `time`, the time frame of the node
# - `label`, the label of the segmentation that was used to create the node
#
# Trackastra likely does something very similar to the regionprops approach you used in Task 1 to get the nodes from the segmentation labels. However, there is an obvious difference: we used the label as the node id, because we knew our segmentation labels did not repeat across time. Since Trackastra does not assume this, it assigns a new `id` for each node.
#
# Trackastra also outputs a list of scores. Each score has:
# - A tuple of node IDs, corresponding to the `id` field in the nodes list
# - A float association score between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating that the model believes the nodes are the same or mother/daughter cells, and a low value indicating the model does not think the cells are associated. By default, scores below 0.05 are not included, although this setting can be changed.
#
# The code below adds a "trackastra_score" attribute to each edge in our candidate graph.

# %%
def add_trackastra_score_attr(cand_graph: nx.DiGraph, trackastra_nodes, trackastra_scores):
    # create a mapping from trackastra node ids to our node ids (which are the segmentation label)
    node_id_map = {
        node["id"]: int(node["label"]) for node in trackastra_nodes
    }
    # find the candidate edge for each predicted score and add the attribute
    for edge, score in trackastra_scores:
        source, target = edge
        cand_source = node_id_map[int(source)]
        cand_target = node_id_map[int(target)]
